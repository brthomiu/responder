# Response Generator WIP

## Todos:

Snippets are not being indexed properly when mapped from the templates which is causing the copy button to only copy the first snippet since they all have the same ID.

Allow users to save templates into local storage, save & import backup templates.

Add a start page that loads the first time the app is used that prompts the user for their name and to setup default templates.
