# Response Generator WIP

## Todos:

Consolidate the useState hooks that hold the orderObjectInfo and snippetInfo into single hooks with an object instead of a ton of hooks that hold each parameter. Will need to make the setters & getters.

Allow users to save templates into local storage, save & import backup templates.

Make a template creation page.

Add different views to the app, a way to create/delete views, and move templates between views.

Add a start page that loads the first time the app is used that prompts the user for their name and to setup default templates.
